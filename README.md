Completion Date: 12/14/2022

## Description
This simple program tests the efficiency of two array search methods, binary and sequential, by
creating two identical integer arrays containing random numbers from 0 to 999, sorting the
second array, and searching for any number of integers chosen by the user using sequential
search on the first array and binary search on the second.
The results of the searches are printed to the screen.
